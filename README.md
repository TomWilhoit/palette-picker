# Palette-Picker
Need help getting design inspiration? Check out Palette-Picker to create and save palettes that are potential fits for your projects! Users can randomize a color palette, keep the colors they want by locking them in, then randomize the rest to try out different combinations. When satisfied with the palette, users can save it to a project.
